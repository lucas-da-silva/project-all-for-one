# Welcome to the All for One project repository!

This project was developed using mySQL, being a very simple project, where I practiced several commands to select, read, update and delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) data from the Northwind database.

Besides, all the queries I used are in the [challenges](./challenges/) directory.

> Apart from the challenges directory and README.md, the other files were developed by [Trybe](https://github.com/tryber).
